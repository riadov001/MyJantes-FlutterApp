## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The application follows a standard Flutter architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

- **Main Entry Point**: Single `main.dart` file bootstraps the app with MaterialApp configuration
- **Screen-Based Navigation**: Separate screen widgets for home, booking, quotes, admin dashboard, and legal pages
- **State Management**: Provider pattern for managing application state and user authentication
- **Service Layer**: Dedicated services for API communication and authentication logic
- **Model Layer**: Data models for bookings, quotes, and user management
- **Theme System**: Centralized theme configuration with MY JANTES branding (red #DC2626, Roboto fonts)

The app implements Material Design 3 principles with custom theming to match the brand identity. The responsive design adapts to mobile, tablet, and web viewport sizes.

### Backend Integration
The Flutter app integrates with a WordPress backend through REST API endpoints:

- **API Service**: HTTP client wrapper for WordPress REST API communication
- **Authentication Service**: JWT-based authentication for admin access
- **File Upload**: Image upload functionality for quote requests with photo attachments
- **Local Storage**: SharedPreferences for caching user preferences and authentication tokens

### Platform-Specific Configurations
